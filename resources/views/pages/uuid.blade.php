  <h2>What is UUID V4?</h2>
  <p>UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) version 4 is a randomly generated identifier composed of 32 hexadecimal digits, typically displayed in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, where each "x" represents a hexadecimal digit and"y" is one of the reserved digits. UUID v4 is generated using random or pseudo-random numbers, ensuring a high probability of uniqueness.</p>
  <p>This type of UUID is widely used across various applications and systems where unique identification is crucial, such as distributed systems, databases, messaging systems, and cryptographic applications. It is particularly favored in scenarios where the chances of generating duplicate identifiers need to be extremely low or practically impossible. Common use cases include session management in web applications, tracking unique user interactions, generating unique identifiers for database records, and creating unique identifiers for files or resources in cloud storage systems</p>
  <p>Additionally, UUID v4 is utilized in security-related applications, such as generating secure tokens, session IDs, or cryptographic keys. Its randomness and uniqueness properties make it suitable for cryptographic operations and secure data transmission. Overall, UUID v4 serves as a reliable solution for generating unique identifiers in a wide range of applications, contributing to robustness, scalability, and security in distributed computing environments.</p>
