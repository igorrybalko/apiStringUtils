  <h2>Unix time stamp</h2>
  <p>The Unix timestamp is a system for tracking time in computing, representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on January 1, 1970, not counting leap seconds. It serves as a universal standard for expressing time across different systems and platforms, making it easier to compare and synchronize chronological data. Unix timestamps are widely used in programming, databases, and various applications for storing and manipulating temporal information due to their simplicity and consistency. This timestamp format is particularly valuable for facilitating date and time calculations and comparisons in a standardized manner within the realm of computer science and software development.</p>
